I’m writing to express my strong interest in backend and systems engineering roles, with a particular passion for working with **Rust**, **Go**, and **TS**.

I’m eager to go beyond coding, contributing to DevRel, product management, or cross-functional projects. As a high-agency engineer, I’m ready to invest extra hours to accelerate my growth over the next few years.

## Background

With 10 years of professional experience, I graduated from a specialized high school for gifted mathematicians in Belgrade and studied Electronics at the University of Belgrade. I began as a silicon designer for two years before transitioning to software engineering in 2017. Limited opportunities in Serbia, financial constraints, and necessary eye surgery prevented me from fully pursuing my goals.

Much of my career focused on frontend (**Angular, React, Next.js, Svelte**), along with backend experience in **Node.js**. For the last two years at [Gel](https://www.geldata.com/) I built SDKs and AI solutions using TypeScript and Python as a tooling/AI engineer.

However, I’ve always gravitated toward backend, low-level systems work where I can solve complex problems and optimize performance. Eight months ago, I committed fully to this path. Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to Rust, Go and backend/system design.

## Recent Focus

- Read [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321).
- Completed the [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/), [Async Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/intro.html),
and [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/).
- Got up to speed with Golang.
- Reading daily [hellointerview](https://www.hellointerview.com/) and various other blogs and resources.
- Practising [algorithms and data structures](https://leetcode.com/u/DijanaPavlovic/).

## Key projects

**Rust**: Built a small [Priority auction marketplace for VM compute hours](https://github.com/diksipav/vmbid) where users can send HTTP requests to buy VM hours, and providers can send requests to sell resources. The system matches buyers with available supply, always prioritizing those willing to pay the highest price. It is designed to handle high concurrency, and if multiple buyers submit requests at the same price, the system serves them in the order their requests were received, using an atomic sequence counter to ensure fairness.

**Go**:[e-commerce-webhooks](https://github.com/diksipav/e-commerce-webhooks) is a webhooks delivery service, that allows merchants to subscribe to events happening in their store (e.g., orders, shipments). Merchants can register webhooks with a URL and a list of events they want to receive, and this service will deliver notifications to those URLs when the events occur.

## Exploration & Contributions

Researched [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/), [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/), [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/), [rustfs](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs) projects, alongside other popular rust crates and libs.

## Why all this

Long term, my goal is to one day co-found a tech startup. Because of that, I’m intentionally seeking environments where I can grow as an engineer, but also develop strong product intuition, communication skills, ownership, and an understanding of how real-world systems and teams operate end to end. I’m excited by roles where I can learn from experienced engineers and leaders, and steadily expand the skill set required to build and ship meaningful products.
