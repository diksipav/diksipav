I’m writing to express my strong interest in backend and systems engineering roles, with a particular passion for working with **Rust**.

## Background  

I am a software engineer with 8 years of professional experience. My journey started in Belgrade, where I attended a high school for gifted mathematicians before studying Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Belgrade. I began my career as a silicon designer for 2 years, then transitioned to software engineering in 2017.  

Big part of my software career has been focused on frontend development (**Angular, React, Next.js, Svelte, Remix**), along with backend experience in **Node.js** and **NestJS**. For the last 2 years, I worked at [Gel](https://www.geldata.com/) as a TypeScript tooling and AI engineer, where I built AI solutions with both TypeScript and Python.  

Despite this, I’ve always felt drawn back to low-level and systems work—where I can tackle more complex problems and focus on performance. Two months ago, I decided to fully commit to this direction.  

## Recent Focus  
Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to Rust and backend/system design:  

- Read ~40% of [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321).  
- Completed ~80% of both the [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) and [Async Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/intro.html).  
- Studied the first 3 chapters of [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) and resources like [CPU caches and memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf).
- Worked through the [Tokio tutorial](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial), read many blog posts, exploring various github projects.
- Reading [CSAP - Computer Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X).
- Trying to understand better Linux, virtual machines and containers...

## I Built a Rust Project  
I built **[redis-streams](https://github.com/diksipav/redis-streams)**, a Rust library inspired by Redis Streams. While it’s an early version (created in 4 days with the help of AI), it gave me hands-on experience with concurrency, locking, and Tokio.  

In retrospect, I realized the design could be improved with a **Radix tree** for efficiency, so I want to explore existing crates or build my own radix tree crate. I also recently learned about **ULID**, which may fit this project well.  

## Current Exploration & Contributions  
I merged few PRs to [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/). 

I’m also preparing to contribute to:  

- [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/) – currently reading their docs, knowledge from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (SSTables, LSM trees, WALs) helps a lot to understand the project.  
- I find very interesting [rust RocksDB](https://github.com/rust-rocksdb/rust-rocksdb) binding.
- Maybe will also contribute to [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) or some other projects I discover.  

## Why Rust & Systems Work  
While I’ve built a career in frontend and AI, my long-term aspiration has always been to design performant systems and solve challenging engineering problems. I’m looking for a role where I can apply my experience, continue learning, and grow within a Rust-focused team. I am also open to full-stack work. It is not that I don't like FE or tooling work—I enjoy programming in general and I am grateful for all the knowledge and skills I have picked up until now. I just want to spend time perfecting my skills in a slightly different area of programming.
