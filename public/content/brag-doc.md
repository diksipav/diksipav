I’ve never really kept track of the things I’ve done in past companies or in my 
free time. But after reading a post about how valuable this can be—for yourself, 
your manager, and your peers—I’ve decided to give it a try. I think it could be 
interesting for anyone browsing this page, since I’ll be sharing projects I’ve 
worked on, open-source contributions, books I’ve read and enjoyed, my startup 
failures (and hopefully some successes), and more.

This timeline begins in April 2025, when I decided to leave [Gel](https://www.geldata.com/)— 
an amazing database startup where I had the chance to work until then.
